  </h2>

  <p>Values are different from goals because while a goal can be met or checked off, <b>living your values is a consistent practice</b> that guides behavior on an ongoing basis. There's no "right" or "wrong" value, and values don't need to match what you think others want from you. </p>

  <p>Consider the list of values below and narrow down your top 3-4 most important values. If you choose to interact with the form here, print this page to save your thoughts. </p>
