      <li>"maybe it will never stop, until we die, and that’s a part of life — life is a constant striving for improvement, and we’d hate to ever stop wanting to improve, because that means we’re dead, right? Even if that means that as we die, we wonder if we could have been better, and our last thought is, “Am I adequate as a person?” Even if that means we are never happy with ourselves, at least we are striving to be happy with ourselves, right?</li>

      <li>"What if instead, we learned to be happy with ourselves?</li>

      <li>"What would happen?</li>

      <li>"Would we stop striving to improve? Would that be horrible, if we were just content and didn’t need to better ourselves every minute of every week? Would we be lazy slobs, or would we instead be happy, and in being happy do things that make us happy rather than make us better? And in being happy, perhaps we would show others how to be happy? And crazy as it might sound, maybe we’d start a little mini-revolution of happiness, so that people wouldn’t feel so inadequate, or need to spend every dime on products, or spend all their time on self-improvement."</li>
    </ul>
    <li>"Pleasure is a commodity now, marketed as a substitute for happiness and on demand"</li>

    <li>"Perfection may be meaningless. We define the inability to transition between emotions as mental illness."</li>

    <li style="font-weight: bold">"Happiness is the result of our actions directed toward other goals"</li>

    <li>"There is no intellectualizing what resonates with you. Meaning is hard to define."</li>
