      <li>"maybe it will never stop, until we die, and that’s a part of life — life is a constant striving for improvement, and we’d hate to ever stop wanting to improve, because that means we’re dead, right? Even if that means that as we die, we wonder if we could have been better, and our last thought is, “Am I adequate as a person?” Even if that means we are never happy with ourselves, at least we are striving to be happy with ourselves, right?</li>

      <li>"What if instead, we learned to be happy with ourselves?</li>

      <li>"What would happen?</li>

      <li>"Would we stop striving to improve? Would that be horrible, if we were just content and didn’t need to better ourselves every minute of every week?

And crazy as it might sound, maybe we’d start a little mini-revolution of happiness, so that people wouldn’t feel so inadequate, or need to spend every dime on products, or spend all their time on self-improvement."</li>
