  <h3>
	What It Sounds Like
  </h3>

  <p>
  	Nothing but the truth now <br>
  	Nothing but the proof of what I am <br>
  	The worst of what I came from, patterns I'm ashamed of <br>
  	Things that even I don't understand
  </p>

<p>
  	I tried to fix it, I tried to fight it<br>
  	My head was twisted, my heart divided<br>
  	My lies all collided<br>
  	I don't know why I didn't trust you to be on my side
  </p>
<p>
  	I broke into a million pieces, and I can't go back <br>
  	But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass <br>
  	The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony <br>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
</p><p>
  	Why did I cover up the colors stuck inside my head? <br>
  	I should've let the jagged edges meet the light instead <br>
  	Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony <br>
  	The song we couldn't write, this is what it sounds like
</p><p>
  	We're shattering the silence, we're rising, defiant <br>
  	Shouting in the quiet, "You're not alone" <br>
  	We listened to the demons, we let them get between us <br>
  	But none of us are out here on our own
</p><p>
  	So we were cowards, so we were liars <br>
  	So we're not heroes, we're still survivors <br>
  	The dreamers, the fighters, no lying, I'm tired <br>
  	But dive in the fire, and I'll be right here by your side
</p><p>
  	We broke into a million pieces, and we can't go back <br>
  	But now we're seeing all the beauty in the broken glass <br>
  	The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony <br>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like (ah)
</p><p>
  	Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head? <br>
  	Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead <br>
  	Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony <br>
  	Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
  </p>
<p>
  	This is what it sounds like <br>
  	Hey! (Oh-oh, oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh) <br>
  	This is what it sounds like <br>
  	Hey! (Oh-oh, oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh) <br>
  	This is what it sounds like <br>
  	Hey! (Oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh) <br>
  	This is what it (sounds like), this is what it <br>
  	This is what it sounds like </p>
<p>
  	We broke into a million pieces, and we can't go back <br>
  	But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass <br>
  	The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony <br>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
  </p>
  <p>
  	Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head? <br>
  	Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead <br>
  	Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony <br>
  	Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
  </p>
  <p>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like <br>
  	Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like <br>
  	Truth after all this time, our voices all combined <br>
  	When darkness meets the light, this is what it sounds like
  </p>

  <h3>Soda Pop </h3>
<p>
  Hey, hey <br>
Hey, hey <br>
Hey
</p>
<p>
Don't want you, need you, yeah, I need you to fill me up <br>
마시고 마셔 봐도, 성에 차지 않아 <br>
Got a feelin' that, oh, yeah (yeah), you could be everything that <br>
That I need (need), taste so sweet (sweet), every sip makes me want more, yeah
</p>
<p>
Lookin' like snacks 'cause you got it like that (whoo) <br>
Take a big bite, want another bite, yeah <br>
너의 모든 걸 난 원해, 원해, 원해 <br>
너 말곤 모두 뻔해, 뻔해, 뻔해 <br>
When you're in my arms, I hold you so tight, so tight <br>
Can't let go, no, no, not tonight
</p>
<p>
지금 당장 날 봐, 시간 없잖아 <br>
넌 내꺼야, 이미 알고 있잖아 <br>
'Cause I need you to need me <br>
I'm empty, you feed me, so refreshin' <br>
My little soda pop
</p><p>
You're all I can think of, every drop I drink up <br>
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop <br>
Cool me down, you're so hot, pour me up, I won't stop <br>
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop <br>
My little soda pop
</p><p>
Uh, make me wanna flip the top, 한 모금에 you hit the spot <br>
Every little drip and drop, fizz and pop, ah, 소름 돋아, it's gettin' hot (whoo) <br>
Yes, I'm sippin' when it's drippin' now, it's done? I need a second round <br>
And pour a lot, and don't you stop 'til my soda pop fizzles out
</p><p>
꿈 속에 그려왔던 너 <br>
난 절대 놓칠 수 없어 <br>
널 원해 꼭, I waited so long for a taste of soda <br>
So, the wait is over, baby <br>
Come and fill me up (just can't get enough, oh)
</p><p>
You're all I can think of, every drop I drink up <br>
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop (yeah, yeah) <br>
Cool me down, you're so hot, pour me up, I won't stop (oh, oh) <br>
You're my soda pop, my little soda pop <br>
Ooh, ooh <br>
Ooh, ooh <br>
You're my soda pop, gotta drink every drop
</p>
