  <h3>
	What It Sounds Like
  </h3>

  <p>
  	Nothing but the truth now <br>
  	Nothing but the proof of what I am <br>
  	The worst of what I came from, patterns I'm ashamed of <br>
  	Things that even I don't understand
  </p>

<p>
  	I tried to fix it, I tried to fight it<br>
  	My head was twisted, my heart divided<br>
  	My lies all collided<br>
  	I don't know why I didn't trust you to be on my side
  </p>
<p>
  	I broke into a million pieces, and I can't go back <br>
  	But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass <br>
  	The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony <br>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
</p><p>
  	Why did I cover up the colors stuck inside my head? <br>
  	I should've let the jagged edges meet the light instead <br>
  	Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony <br>
  	The song we couldn't write, this is what it sounds like
</p><p>
  	We're shattering the silence, we're rising, defiant <br>
  	Shouting in the quiet, "You're not alone" <br>
  	We listened to the demons, we let them get between us <br>
  	But none of us are out here on our own
</p><p>
  	So we were cowards, so we were liars <br>
  	So we're not heroes, we're still survivors <br>
  	The dreamers, the fighters, no lying, I'm tired <br>
  	But dive in the fire, and I'll be right here by your side
</p><p>
  	We broke into a million pieces, and we can't go back <br>
  	But now we're seeing all the beauty in the broken glass <br>
  	The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony <br>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like (ah)
</p><p>
  	Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head? <br>
  	Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead <br>
  	Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony <br>
  	Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
  </p>
<p>
  	This is what it sounds like <br>
  	Hey! (Oh-oh, oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh) <br>
  	This is what it sounds like <br>
  	Hey! (Oh-oh, oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh) <br>
  	This is what it sounds like <br>
  	Hey! (Oh-oh), hey! (Oh-oh) <br>
  	This is what it (sounds like), this is what it <br>
  	This is what it sounds like </p>
<p>
  	We broke into a million pieces, and we can't go back <br>
  	But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass <br>
  	The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony <br>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like
  </p>
  <p>
  	Why did we cover up the colors stuck inside our head? <br>
  	Get up and let the jagged edges meet the light instead <br>
  	Show me what's underneath, I'll find your harmony <br>
  	Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like
  </p>
  <p>
  	My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like <br>
  	Fearless and undefined, this is what it sounds like <br>
  	Truth after all this time, our voices all combined <br>
  	When darkness meets the light, this is what it sounds like
  </p>
