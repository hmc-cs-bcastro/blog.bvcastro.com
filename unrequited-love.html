    A naive poem I wrote in high school
  </p>
  <p>I know I should not.
  <br>
  I cannot although I really want to.
  <br>
  I’m inexpert and thus
  <br>
  my unrequited love is up to you.</p>

  <p>To love someone like you,
    <br>
  I never thought I would do.
  <br>
  If I know what love is,
  <br>
  it is because of only you.</p>

  <p>He was he. She–she. Dogs–dogs.
    <br>
  I saw everyone the same.
  <br>
  Then, a few months later I looked at you-
  <br>
  Thee... as sweet as aspartame.</p>

  <p>“I don’t look at you like I do the rest.
    <br>
  I… I have my first crush
  <br>
  on a guy I barely know.”
  <br>
  Him–the first to make me gush.</p>

  <p>“Nah, I’ve felt lonely.
    <br>
  It’s just my silly head.
  <br>
  You smiled at me. I want to be loved.
  <br>
  It’s not true.” That’s what I said.</p>

  <p>Yet months later
    <br>
  this feeling had not changed.
  <br>
  I only loved you more,
  <br>
  knew it was not feigned.</p>

  <p>I knew I shouldn’t have, but
    <br>
  “If you press me to say why I loved him,
  <br>
  I can say no more than because he was he,
  <br>
  and I was I.” ‘Twas at whim.</p>

  <p>I came up with adroit plans
    <br>
  to be with you any given chance.
  <br>
  Given a hug once in a blue moon,
  <br>
  that was my romance.</p>

  <p>You are just so affable and kind—
    <br>
  my haven—but you do not see,
  <br>
  for when you hug me it means so much more—
  <br>
  I want to hug you indefinitely.</p>

  <p>I hold grudges over myself,
    <br>
  over superficial things… greed.
  <br>
  Yet if I had you they would not matter
  <br>
  because you are all I need.</p>

  <p>Finally, my master plan succeeded!
    <br>
  I told you of my love.
  <br>
  You hugged me—the best moment of my life!
  <br>
  But you were still aloof thereof.</p>

  <p>I thought you liked me.
    <br>
  Of course, only as a friend.
  <br>
  But now it seems I irk you,
  <br>
  which is not what I intend.</p>

  <p>I’ll see you and say “hi.”
    <br>
  You may reply but without interest.
  <br>
  You have much on your mind, I know,
  <br>
  But… a conversation? Even the simplest?</p>

  <p>I see you everyday,
    <br>
  always in propinquity.
  <br>
  And my heart cries
  <br>
  because you leave me.</p>

  <p>How do I express my unsatiated desire?
    <br>
  Poetry is hard to interpret and love hard to explain.
  <br>
  Thus I turn to the poetic form
  <br>
  to purge of this feeling so arcane.</p>

  <p>If you only knew I truly love you.
    <br>
  I know you do not love me the same way.
  <br>
  I know you do not mean to lead me on.
  <br>
  But I yearn your friendship each day.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I see you angered,
    <br>
  critiquing yourself as subpar,
  <br>
  only because—as I want no one else to see—
  <br>
  you do not know how amazing you are.</p>

  <p>Even your name could be no better,
    <br>
  meaning “gift of God.”
  <br>
  You are a gift to the world-
  <br>
  you whom I—and many others—laud.</p>

  <p>I have a million and one reasons for this-
    <br>
  a million and one reasons I fell in love with not him but you.
  <br>
  And I know that when I looked at you that day,
  <br>
  I had crossed the Rubicon, leaving myself askew.</p>

  <p>It has become quite the dilemma.
    <br>
  I want you, but the reality I know.
  <br>
  Yet as much sense as moving on makes,
  <br>
  you I cannot forgo.</p>

  <p>You are not perfect, but—for me—you are perfect.
    <br>
  With you, I can be carefree.
  <br>
  I need you because I love you.
  <br>
  Now if only you needed me.</p>

  <p>They say all who fall in love become a poet.
    <br>
  And that having thy unrequited love within reach hurts most.
  <br>
  I never believed either to be true,
  <br>
  but that was before I met you.</p>
